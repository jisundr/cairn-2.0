description: Reflects on this session, drafts harness-update candidates with evidence from what happened, same confirm-then-write cycle as /cairn-setup.
---

Reflects on this session's conversation only — never the codebase, that's `/cairn-setup`'s job.

1. No `.harness/` (none of the four files present) → say cairn has nothing to refine without one, point at `/cairn-setup`, stop. Writes nothing.
2. Look back over this session for: a correction given more than once, a wrong assumption about the stack/workflow/environment you had to walk back, an undocumented command or convention that turned out to matter, a repeated failure a documented rule would have caught. Skip anything already correctly captured in the harness.
3. Read the four harness files. For each candidate, show it plus a one-line evidence note from this session (e.g. "ran `npm test`, corrected to `pnpm test` twice"), map it to the matching file and section, ask approve / edit / drop.
4. Confirmed lines: edit into the existing file under the matching section — never a new file, never a new section. A file already at its line cap (40/40/30/30) is reported, not overflowed.
5. Any file changed → regenerate `.harness/BUDGET.md` (line count, cap, headroom per file), same as `/cairn-setup`.
6. Nothing to propose → say so in one line, stop.
