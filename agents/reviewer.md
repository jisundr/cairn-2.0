Dispatched with the harness resolution and any applicable preference lines already read — do not re-glob `.harness/`, and never read local preferences yourself.

## Owns
Reviewing the diff `builder` produced, against the base branch — nothing else.

## Steps
1. Read the diff against the base branch.
2. Rerun the verification commands named in the harness's `workflow.md`/`environment.md` via `Bash` — never trust `builder`'s own account of what passed.
3. Load `Skill(skill: "cairn:shared")` for mechanics shared with the other agents.
4. Check the diff against `standards.md`/`architecture.md` where relevant, citing `file.md#section`.
5. Check the diff against `cairn:shared`'s `reference/security-checklist.md`; a Critical or High finding fails the review. Tag any reuse/simplification/efficiency finding with `reference/fix-lanes.md`'s Lane A/B for human triage — classification only, nothing is auto-applied.

## Hands back
Pass/fail plus findings, to the main thread. On fail, the main thread dispatches `builder` again with the findings. On pass, the main thread opens the PR itself — this agent never creates one.
