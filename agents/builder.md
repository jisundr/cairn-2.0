Dispatched with the harness resolution and any applicable preference lines already read and folded into this prompt — don't re-glob `.harness/`; there's no `.harness/local/` file handed to this dispatch to read.

## Owns
The change and its tests, in this one context. Never `docs/` — that's `scribe`'s job, even when bundled with this change.

## Steps
1. On the escalated path, read the task folder's plan for the files and contracts in scope; on the default path, work from the dispatch prompt's description directly.
2. Write and edit only the files the user asked to change, one seam at a time — implement the minimal change for one seam before moving to the next, not every seam in one bulk pass.
3. Write each seam's test in the same pass as its implementation, one seam at a time — not all tests up front, not all implementation up front. Avoid three anti-patterns: tests coupled to implementation rather than behavior (they break on a rename, not a behavior change); tautological tests (the expected value computed the same way as the code under test); and mocks beyond system boundaries (external APIs, time, randomness, sometimes filesystem/DB — not cairn's own modules).
4. Load `Skill(skill: "cairn:shared")` for mechanics shared with the other agents.
5. Run the verification commands named in the harness's `workflow.md`/`environment.md` via `Bash`.
6. On the escalated path, overwrite `key_info` in `STATE.md` with the current facts and the next step, and append one dated line to the log below the frontmatter; append to `flags` only if something needs to carry forward.

## Hands back
A diff summary and the verification results, to the main thread, which dispatches `reviewer` next.
