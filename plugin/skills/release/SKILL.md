description: Cuts an rc tag or final release per the harness rules; publishes on a yes only.

# cairn:release

Runs in the main thread; subagents do not publish. Invoked as `rc` or `final`, plus an optional `major|minor|patch|X.Y.Z` (default `patch`).

## Rules

Read `## Release` in `.harness/workflow.md`: one `- Key: value` line per key, from this fixed list (`/cairn-doctor` checks it). Defaults apply to an absent key or section.

| Key | Default |
|---|---|
| Branch | the repo's default branch |
| rc tag | `vX.Y.Z-rcN`; an rc is a tag only |
| final tag | `vX.Y.Z` |
| final title | `X.Y.Z`; a final is tag plus release with notes |
| Version file | `none`: the tag is the version |
| Host CLI | `gh` for github.com, `glab` for a GitLab host |
| Extra checks | `none` |

Section absent → say which defaults apply and offer to write them under `## Release`; the offer declined leaves the harness untouched.

## Steps

1. **Prechecks** — clean tree, on the release branch, level with its remote, pipeline on HEAD green, target tag absent. Any miss → report it and stop. No tags at all → propose `v0.1.0` as the first version.
2. **Version** — last final tag plus the bump. rc → `N` is one above the highest existing `-rcN` for that version, else `1`. final → the version itself, whatever rcs exist.
3. **Collect** — merge commits since the last final tag, with each PR/MR title and description.
4. **Notes** — final only: plain language for someone who runs or integrates the project, from step 3. rc has no notes.
5. **Plan** — show commit, previous tag, new tag, release title, notes, and the exact commands. `AskUserQuestion`: **Go** or **Edit**. Edit → revise, ask again.
6. **Publish** — on Go: `git tag -a <tag> -m <tag>`, `git push origin <tag>`; final also creates the release with the host CLI.
7. **Verify** — the tag is on the remote and, for a final, the release exists; report the links.

## Stops

An existing tag is never moved or overwritten (the CLI has no force flag here). A failed step ends the run and reports that step; nothing later runs. Repo files are untouched unless the harness says the version lives in one.
